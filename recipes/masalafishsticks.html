<li>1 pound cod fish fillets</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, or to taste</li>
<li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Preheat the oven to 450°F.</h3>
        Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and spray with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
        
        <li><h3>Prepare the fish:</h3>
        Using paper towels, pat the fish dry on both sides.

        <li><h3>Make a dredging station:</h3>
        In a medium bowl, combine the flour, garam masala, and cayenne powder and season with salt and pepper. In another medium bowl, whisk together the egg and milk and season lightly with salt. In a third medium bowl, add the panko and season with salt and pepper.

        Dredge the fish sticks:
        Working with one fish stick at a time, dip it into the flour mixture, ensuring it is coated evenly. Dip in egg wash next, letting any excess briefly drip off, then coat in the panko. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
        
        Repeat with the remaining fish sticks and make sure all sides of the fish sticks are well coated.</li>
        
       <li><h3> Bake the fish sticks:</h3> 
        Spread the fish sticks out on the baking sheet in a single layer. Spray the tops with cooking spray.
        
        Bake the fish sticks until they are cooked through and crispy on the outside, 12 to 15 minutes, flipping halfway through baking. They will not be especially brown.
        
        Sprinkle the fish sticks with salt. Serve them warm with a dipping sauce of your choice.</li>
